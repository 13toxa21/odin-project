# Sending Params with RestClient

Project Source: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/basic-routes-views-and-controllers?ref=lc-pb

**Odin's Notes:** In this project, you'll get a chance to interact with a Rails application from the command line by sending requests manually. You'll first build a very simple app (to get some practice with the steps involved in creating a new one) and then a simple script which uses the RestClient gem (which you used in the first project) to send some requests and examine the server output.
