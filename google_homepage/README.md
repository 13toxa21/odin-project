## Odin's Notes

"DONT BE A PERFECTIONIST! You're just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored."

In other words, don't expect this to actual DO anything...
