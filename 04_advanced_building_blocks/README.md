## Bubble Sort

[bubble_sort.rb](https://github.com/craftykate/odin-project/blob/master/04_advanced_building_blocks/bubble_sort.rb)

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?).

```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
    => [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```
