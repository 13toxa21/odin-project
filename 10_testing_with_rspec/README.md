## Caesar Cipher with RSpec

[caesar_cipher_rspec](https://github.com/craftykate/odin-project/tree/master/10_testing_with_rspec/caesar_cipher_rspec)

Go back to the Building Blocks Project and write tests for your "Caesar's Cipher" code. It shouldn't take more than a half-dozen tests to cover all the possible cases.

## Enumerables with RSpec

[enumerables_rspec](https://github.com/craftykate/odin-project/tree/master/10_testing_with_rspec/enumerables_rspec)

Go back to the Advanced Building Blocks Project and write tests for any 6 of the enumerable methods you wrote there. In this case, identify several possible inputs for each of those functions and test to make sure that your implementation of them actually makes the tests pass. Be sure to try and cover some of the odd edge cases where you can.
