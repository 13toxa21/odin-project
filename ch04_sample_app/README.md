# Sample Rails App

Project Source: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/getting-your-feet-wet

This is a VERY basic Rails app that has users and microposts built with scaffolding. Users have many microposts and each micropost has one user. There's almost no functionality, but it was just an intro project.
