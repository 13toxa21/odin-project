Beautiful little jQuery calculator, including "tape" feature to keep track of your calculations. Includes Clear/All Clear button, plus/minus, percent, and a full suite of memory buttons.

## Features 

### Tape 

The tape scrolls when it gets too long for its div, and has a handy feature of staying at the bottom - so you always see your last calculations and don't have to scroll each time it adds a new line. 

### Clear

The Clear button changes from "All Clear" to "Clear" when you add a second number - so it keeps the first number and lets you change your mind on the second. Once you press it, it goes back to an "All Clear" button so if you press it again you start fresh. The tape starts a new line when you press "All Clear" as well. 

### Memory

Memory buttons work just as they should - plus it tells you in the top corner what the value is. I hesitate to use the memory buttons on a regular calculator because I'm never quite sure what the stored value is. 

### Operators

If you press an operator button (plus, minus, multiply, divide) it will stay grayed out until you enter the next number so you know you hit the right operator.
