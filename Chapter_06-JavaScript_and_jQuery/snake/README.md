## Features

### Move your snake

Use arrow keys to change snake's direction.

Snake is green. Food is red. Eat the food. But don't eat yourself or go off the board!

### Level Up!

Every 5 pieces of food you eat advances you to the next level. Each new level gives you more points for each piece of food and the snake goes even faster. Can you keep up?? 

### Bonus Points

Water is blue. Drink the water! It gives you double points. You only get water after you level up a couple times - but hurry, it dries up after just a few seconds.

If you're extra special you'll get GOLD. Get that gold! It's worth TRIPLE points and slows you down a little, so it's very valuable - but it disappears fast.

### High Scores

Enter your name to play against your friends. Top 10 scores will be displayed in the sidebar.
