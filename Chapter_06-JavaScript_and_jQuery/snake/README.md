## Features

### Move your snake

Use the arrow keys to move your snake. Eat food to increase your points.

### Level Up!

Every 5 pieces of food you eat advances you to the next level. Each new level gives you more points for each piece of food and the snake goes even faster. Can you keep up?? 

### High Scores

Your highest 10 scores will be listed on the sidebar so you can see how you fared. 

### Play again?

At the end of each round you get to decide if you're done, or if you want to go again and see if you can beat your high score.
